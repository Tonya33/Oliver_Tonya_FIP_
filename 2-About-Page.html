            <h3>About the Artist</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Tonya! I am a spirital Mama who loves creating in so many ways!
                I started my journey as a young, free-spirited bartender. After
                becoming sober in December 2020, I decided to go back to school and
                develop my skills as a difital artist, but my passion is everything occultic
                See, Jewelry is just the start. I have become obsessed with the law of Attraction and energy frenquencies. RAW STONE is a way of
                sharing my love of all things energetically pleasing. Join me on
                this journey as I unfold the endless creative possibilty that the<br> 
                sober world has to offer!
